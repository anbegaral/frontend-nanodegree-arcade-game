===============================

This project has been developed as an exercise for **Udacity Front End Nanodegree**. It recreates the classic arcade game [Frogger](http://www.classicgamesarcade.com/game/21607/frogger.html) and its goal is to serve as a tool to evaluate the obtained skills during this module (and have fun :).

## Rules
The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.

## Usage
The user can select the character to play clicking over the pictures. The player has got **three lifes** to play, when the character collides with the bug one life is lost. When the player run out of lifes the game is over.

The player can move:
- **left**: left arrow,
- **right**: right arrow,
- **up**: up arrow,
- **down**: down arrow

Once the game is won, F5 has to be pressed to play again .

## Installation
As the game is developed in javascript, there is no need of installation, just clone the GitHub repository and open the "index.html" file with the browser.
